Critino is a cutting-edge platform designed to transform how AI systems learn from human feedback. By replacing abstract rules with concrete examples and leveraging semantic search, Critino enables developers and businesses to create AI applications that consistently deliver desired outcomes. Our intuitive critique-based training system makes AI alignment more accessible, scalable, and effective.

## **Key Features**

- **Concrete Examples Over Abstract Rules**: Replace vague instructions with specific examples of desired behavior.
- **Structured Critique Format**: Each critique includes context, query, optimal response, and situation for precise guidance.
- **Semantic Search Integration**: Match new queries with relevant critiques to ensure accurate and consistent AI responses.
- **Scalability**: Add unlimited critiques to handle a growing range of situations without being constrained by context size.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Enable AI agents to learn and improve over time based on user feedback.

## **How Critino Works**

1. **Create Critiques**:

   - Define the context, query, optimal response, and situation for each critique.
   - Example: For a customer service AI, a critique might include a sample complaint, context, and the ideal empathetic response.

2. **Semantic Search**:

   - Critino uses semantic search to match new queries with the most relevant critiques, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses.

3. **Train Your AI**:

   - Use critiques to guide your AI’s behavior, improving alignment with user intentions over time.

4. **Scale and Improve**:
   - Continuously add critiques to expand your AI’s capabilities and handle new scenarios.

## **Roadmap**

- **Automated Critique Generation**: Use AI to generate critiques from historical data or user feedback.
- **Fine-Tuning Integration**: Combine critiques with fine-tuning for even better model performance.
